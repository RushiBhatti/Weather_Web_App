### NOTE  
This repository contains the HTML, JSP, CSS, Servlet and Image files for a web application. *The folder structure and additional project files necessary for running a J2EE application on a server are not included.*

To run this application, you will need to:

- Create a standard J2EE project structure and copy these files into the appropriate locations.
- Configure a web server to recognize JSP and Servlet files.
